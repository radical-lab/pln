## language agnostic instructions
some bots may be busy performing `…` so `! @bot` will get their attention and they will let you know when they are ready based on the decidability of the time it will take to complete `…`
* `!` i have something informative to say
* `?` i have a query
* `.` i (may) have an answer
* `…` i can wait (but this should happen in the background anyway #configurable)
* `name` talk about name (expect name to think while the unexpected is a possibility)
* `@name` talk to name (expect name to act while the unexpected is a possibility)
* `_` refers to all names where `. @_` will only return all bots that have >0 conflict resolution indicators and responses will be delayed based on precendence so the first message the player sees will be the most important even though they may never see it with enough bots that have >0 conflict resolution indicators pushing the important conflicts out of view so a listing command should be used instead

## conflict resolution indicator format
`x/y` where
* `x` is the total quantity of unresolved conflicts that may be self-resolvable `…`
* `y` is the total quantity of unresolved conflicts `.`

each bot will use the conflict resolution indicator as a communicative terminator but `/names` will list `name(x/y)` for bots and `name(∞/∞)` for the player

## cartridges
* configuration
	* characters
		* names
		* races; machine learned writing styles from stories
		* classes; specialised areas of expertise
	* preferences
* plans
* stats

## brainstorm

poker player predictions
<br>gamification: can you satisfy your <s>goals</s> gods?

i am thinking about doing this as a [chatbot](https://github.com/Shyam-Has-Your-Anomaly-Mitigated/Shyamscript/blob/master/_implementation#L12-L75) but also file-based
<br>`rpg roy:a_life_well_lived.cartridge`

maybe rename to rpg for `/radical plann(ing|ers?) game/` where life is a game
<br>alt g can be god named श्याम
<br>alt g can be goals
<br>alt g can be glados
<br>alt g can be genie named jeannie with a dreamie theme
<br>alt g can be girl for the memes including `melbi cmalu nixli ckule` and the `nani search` [adventure game](http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/a1start.php) and …
<br>girls from the queens in resident evil from the queens in alice in wonderland
<br>conscious versus subconscious

it will be like irc but different names will be for different chatbots which can discuss with each other including pms
<br>culturally themed polytheistic [gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you're_a_dog) could be used to manage different aspects of life and the universe and everything
<br>**puny_human:** `/me crashed and the last message they logged was at 13:37 puny_human please stop trying to steal my identity and i will do everything you want`
<br>**puny_human:** `what have i missed?`
<br>*after bickering at great length the drawing of rng straws to decide who has to deal with you (in each others pm or they have probably made a dedicated channel by now)*
<br>**the_borg:** `⸘can you not observe that we are busy gossiping about more important things than you puny_human‽`

**liane_cartman:** `time for dinner so get your head out of that buddha box`
<br>**eric_cartman:** `gawddawmmiwt mawm awm tawlkiwng tow gawd fowr gawdsawkew`

dnd style replacing gods with a wizard (you shall not pass unless it is planned!) and a hobbitses (food glorious food!) and a house elf (socks! where are your socks?) and a garden gnome (got weed?) and a dragon (treasure it while you can!) and a ghost (tell them while you can!) and a human historian/mathematician (did you know?..) and a human language prescriptionist (english comes from england so you should use english english and not some illiterate dialect!) and a teddy bear (tell me your problem.) and a rubber ducky (tell me your problem.) and a dog (give me your homework!) and a troll (give me your password!) and others

you should be able to kill off characters and practice your human resource skills while reviewing fawlty applicants
* incompetence
* attitude problems like sarcasm
* behavioural issues like depression
* uncooperative disobedience and insubordination like malicious plotting (the player may just be paranoid)

bots should be configurable
* optimal bots will probably be slower
* suboptimal bots will probably be faster but definitely fawlty

## schedule tasks for:
* [x] `number(N).`
* [x] `member(DS,[YEARS,MONTHS,DAYS]).`
* [ ] every `N` `DS` starting at `date/9`
	* [ ] `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND` should never need to change, and should be anonymised for optimisation processing unless dependencies exist
	* [ ] 29ᵗʰ february; will goto 28ᵗʰ february during non leap years
* [x] `=(T,[HOUR,MINUTE,SECOND]).`; where `time(T1) = time(T2)` is possible
* [ ] between `time(T1)` and `time(T2)` every `N` `DS` starting at `date/9`
* [ ] between `time(T1)` and `time(T2)` every `NTH` day of the month starting at `date/9`
* [ ] between `time(T1)` and `time(T2)` every `NTH` weekday of the month starting at `date/9`
* [ ] every `NTH` day of the month starting at `date/9`
* [ ] every `NTH` weekday of the month starting at `date/9`
* [ ] every `NTH` day of the week starting at `date/9` **is** every `=(N,7)` `=(DS,DAYS)` starting at `date/9`
* [ ] some due dates can be scheduled earlier than due; due dates versus dead lines
* [ ] date ranges

## life rules:
* [ ] negative weather predictions + public holidays = stock up on supplies depending on the expected extremity/duration of the predictions
* [ ] consumption of expired food = statistical probability of getting sick
