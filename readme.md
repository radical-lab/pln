<br>gamification: can you satisfy your <s>goals</s> gods?

i am thinking about doing this as a [chatbot](https://github.com/Shyam-Has-Your-Anomaly-Mitigated/Shyamscript/blob/master/_implementation#L12-L75) but also file-based
<br>`rpg roy:a_life_well_lived.cartridge`

maybe rename to rpg for `/radical plann(ing|ers?) game/` where life is a game
<br>alt g can be god named श्याम
<br>alt g can be goals
<br>alt g can be glados
<br>alt g can be genie named jeannie with a dreamie theme
<br>alt g can be girl for the memes including `melbi cmalu nixli ckule` and the `nani search` [adventure game](http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/a1start.php) and …
<br>girls from the queens in resident evil from the queens in alice in wonderland
<br>conscious versus subconscious

it will be like irc but different names will be for different chatbots which can discuss with each other including pms
<br>culturally themed polytheistic [gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you're_a_dog) could be used to manage different aspects of life and the universe and everything

<br>**the_borg:** `⸘can you not observe that we are busy gossiping about more important things than you puny_human‽`

* [x] `number(N).`
* [x] `member(DS,[YEARS,MONTHS,DAYS]).`
* [ ] every `N` `DS` starting at `date/9`
	* [ ] `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND` should never need to change, and should be anonymised for optimisation processing unless dependencies exist
	* [ ] 29ᵗʰ february; will goto 28ᵗʰ february during non leap years
* [x] `=(T,[HOUR,MINUTE,SECOND]).`; where `time(T1) = time(T2)` is possible
* [ ] between `time(T1)` and `time(T2)` every `N` `DS` starting at `date/9`

* [ ] negative weather predictions + public holidays = stock up on supplies depending on the expected extremity/duration of the predictions
* [ ] consumption of expired food = statistical probability of getting sick
